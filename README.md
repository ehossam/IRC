# IRC
This tool provides an implementation of Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol where clients communicate with each other.<br/><br/>
This system employs a central-server which relays messages that are sent to it to other connected users.<br/><br/>
Users can join rooms, which are groups of users that are subscribed to the same message stream. Any message sent to that room is forwarded to all users currently joined to that room.<br/><br/>
Users can also send private messages to other users.<br/><br/>
**For more information on the protocol and how to execute commands on this tool, please refere to the Reuest For Comment (RFC) pdf file included in the repo.**
